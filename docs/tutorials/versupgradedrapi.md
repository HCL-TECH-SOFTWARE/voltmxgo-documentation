## Upgrade Volt MX Go Foundry

The following procedures guide you in upgrading Volt MX Go Foundry to the latest version. As Volt MX Go Foundry supports various installation mechanisms, refer to the relevant upgrade procedure.

### For using an installer

!!!warning "Important"
    The upgrade process works by upgrading the existing database to the latest version, and installing fresh application server artifacts, such as data sources and WARs. For installation details such as hostname, database port, prefix, suffix, you must refer to the installation logs of your previous setup.

    The installer does not support automatic backups of database and other artifacts. You must clean up the existing application server artifacts and take a backup of the custom artifacts.
    The installer also does not support rollback in case of a failure during the upgrade. To roll back, restore the database and server artifacts you backed up before upgrading.
