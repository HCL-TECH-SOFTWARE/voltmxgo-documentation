## For using helm charts on a supported Kubernetes platform
  
!!!note "Prerequisite"
    [Obtain authentication token from HCL Container Repository](obtainauthenticationtoken.md) before proceeding.

### For Volt MX Go v2.1

!!!note
    Starting with Volt MX Go v2.1, only one helm chart `voltmx-foundry` is used for Volt MX Go Foundry installation.

1. Create a namespace and a temp directory for the charts.

    Run the following commands to create a namespace, set the current context to **mxgo**, create a temp directory for downloading the charts, and make it the current directory:

    ```
    kubectl create namespace mxgo
    kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=mxgo
    mkdir ~/mxgo
    cd ~/mxgo
    ```

    --8<-- "restartwindows.md"

2. Configure Helm to pull from HCL Container Repository.

    The step sets up Helm with the details necessary to authenticate with the HCL Container Repository. You will need your [email and authentication token](obtainauthenticationtoken.md) used with the HCL Container Repository.

    - Run the following command to set up Helm:

        ```
        helm repo add hclcr https://hclcr.io/chartrepo/voltmxgo --username <your hclcr username> --password <your hclcr password>
        ```

        !!!example
            `helm repo add hclcr https://hclcr.io/chartrepo/voltmxgo --username user.name@example.com --password xx3ds2w`


        !!!note
            Use the **CLI secret** value you saved from [obtaining authentication token from HCL Container Repository](obtainauthenticationtoken.md) as your authentication token or password.

        If you get an error message similar to the following:

        ``` { .yaml .no-copy }
        Error: looks like https://hclcr.io/chartrepo/voltmxgo is not a valid chart repository or cannot be reached: failed to fetch https://hclcr.io/chartrepo/voltmxgo/index.yaml : 401 Unauthorized
        ```

        Most likely, you haven't specified your username or authentication token correctly. Make sure the case and content matches exactly what's listed on the HCL Container Repository site and retry.

3. Download Foundry chart.

    1. Run the following command to make sure that the chart information for the repositories is up-to-date.

        ```
        helm repo update
        ```

        --8<-- "helmversion.md"

    2. Run the following commands to download the Foundry chart, unpack the files, and move the `values.yaml` file to the current directory:

        ```
        mkdir foundry
        cd foundry
        helm pull hclcr/voltmx-foundry
        tar -xzf voltmx-foundry-1.n.n.tgz
        mv voltmx-foundry/values.yaml  ./
        mv voltmx-foundry/init-guids.sh  ./
        chmod +x init-guids.sh
        ```
        !!!note
            The chart name has a version string in the filename. The `helm pull` command will pull down the latest version of the chart. Ensure your tar command uses the correct matching filename.


    3. Volt MX Go Foundry uses several Global Unique IDs to distinguish different installations of Volt MX Go Foundry. Invoke the init-guids script to generate the IDs using the following command:
    
        ```
        ./init-guids.sh --new
        ```

    4. Edit the `values.yaml` file to update the `imageCredentials` by replacing `your-email` and `your-authentication-token` with your [email and authentication token](obtainauthenticationtoken.md) used with the HCL Container Repository.

        ```{ .yaml .no-copy }
        imageCredentials:
        username: your-email
        password: your-authentication-token
        ```

        !!!note
            Use the **CLI secret** value you saved from [obtaining authentication token from HCL Container Repository](obtainauthenticationtoken.md) as your authentication token or password.

    5. Locate the following line in the file and add your Volt MX Go Foundry server domain name setting:

        ```{ .yaml .no-copy }
        serverDomainName:
        ```
        
        Whatever server domain name you specify here, you need to ensure that it's resolvable. There is no additional work if you have already registered your server domain name in DNS. However, if you haven't registered it, you must add it to the server's /etc/hosts file [Ensure Foundry Hostnames are resolvable](prereq.md#3-ensure-foundry-hostnames-are-resolvable), substituting your server domain name. Additionally, you must make the same updates in k3s's coredns config map as described in [For K3s only](prereq.md#for-k3s-only) again substituting your server domain name.

    6. Locate the following lines in the file and add your Volt MX Go Foundry database details:

        ```{ .yaml .no-copy }
        ### Database details ###

        # Database type which you want to use for Volt MX Go Foundry (String)
        # Possible values:
        #   "mysql" for MySQL DB server
        #   "sqlserver" for Azure MSSQL or SQLServer
        #   "oracle" for Oracle DB server
        dbType:

        # Database server hostname (String)
        dbHost:

        # Database server port number (Number). This can be empty for cloud managed service.
        dbPort:

        # Database User and password - you may set a single general userid/password here,
        # or you may set specific userid/password combinations below.  If set, the
        # specific values override the general dbUser/dbPass.

        # Database server user (String)
        dbUser:

        # Database server password (String) enclosed in quotes
        dbPass:
        ```

    7. For more advanced configuration options, see [Configuration](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmxfoundry_containers_helm/Content/Installing_Containers_With_Helm.html#configuration) in the *Installation Guide for Volt MX Foundry Containers Helm Installation*.

    8. Save the file and exit.

4. (Optional) Perform advanced scenario procedures.

    Perform the procedures under [Advanced Scenarios](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmxfoundry_containers_helm/Content/Installing_Containers_With_Helm_Advanced_Scenarios.html).
