## Upgrade Volt MX Go Foundry

The following procedures guide you in upgrading Volt MX Go Foundry to the latest version. As Volt MX Go Foundry supports various installation mechanisms, refer to the relevant upgrade procedure.

### For using an installer

The upgrade process works by upgrading the existing database to the latest version, and installing fresh application server artifacts, such as data sources and WARs. For installation details such as hostname, database port, prefix, suffix, you must refer to the installation logs of your previous setup.

The installer doesn't support automatic backups of database and other artifacts. You must clean up the existing application server artifacts and take a backup of the custom artifacts. The installer also doesn't support rollback in case of a failure during the upgrade. To roll back, restore the database and server artifacts you backed up before upgrading.

<!--Upgrades Volt MX Go Foundry from Volt MX Go v2.0.4 to Volt MX Go v2.1.-->

#### Before you begin

- Back up your databases and server artifacts.

- Download the latest Volt Foundry installer based on your installation platform. The minimum supported version is v9.5.18.0. For more information, see [Download HCL Volt MX Go installers](../portaldownload.md#for-volt-mx-go-v21-or-later).

- Download and install the latest Volt MX Go Plugin Installer. For more information, see [Install Volt MX Go Plugin Installer](../installserver/installdrapi.md#install-volt-mx-go-plugin-installer).

- Ensure that the Volt Foundry installer has execute permission.
- Ensure that you have the path of your previous installation directory.
- Ensure that you stop the application server of your existing Volt MX Go Foundry instance, which you want to upgrade.
