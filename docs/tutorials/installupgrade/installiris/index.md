In the Volt MX Go v2.1 or later release, Volt Iris is first installed, followed by installing the necessary plugins using the Volt MX Go Plugin Installer. The plugins enable the capabilities unique to Volt MX Go. Additionally, the plugins must be reinstalled each time Volt Iris is upgraded.

    After installing the plugins, connect Volt Iris to Volt Foundry licensed with a Volt MX Go entitlement to enable and use the Volt MX Go features in Volt Iris.
