# Design Import tutorial
 
 This tutorial guides you in accessing Design Import in Volt MX Go through the use of Volt MX Iris to view the `.nsf` file. This feature in Volt MX Go Iris is a way to extract the domino`.nsf` file where you can design the `.nsf` structure in **Volt MX GO Iris** synchronously to the **Domino Designer** server. 

## Before you start

<!--!!!note
    Make sure you have downloaded the latest version of Volt MX Go Iris before performing the installation.-->

- You have completed the [Volt MX Go installation](installation.md).
- You have created your [Foundry admin account](../howto/foundryadminaccount.md).
<!-- You have noted the following Domino REST API details:
    
    - Domino REST API server URL 
    - username: `mxgo admin`
    - password: `password`

    !!!note
        - If you updated the administrator's first name, last name, and password in the `values.yaml` file in the [Download the Domino REST API Helm chart](http://localhost:8000/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/voltmxgo-documentation/tutorials/downloadhelmchart.html#1-download-the-domino-rest-api-helm-chart) procedure as part of the containerized deployment, use the updated values for the username and password.
        - If you used the installer to install Domino REST API, use your Domino server administrator username and password.-->
- You have created Domino REST API.

- All users in VoltMX Go that are performing a Design Import need to be [added to the LocalKeepAdmins](https://help.hcltechsw.com/notes/12.0.2/client/sec_acl_useradd_t.html) group in the Domino Keep Configuration (KeepConfig.nsf) Access Control List for access to administrative API used by Design Import. 

- You have a configured `.nsf` file, `schema`,`scopes` and application in [Domino Rest API](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/Domino-rest-api/references/usingdominorestapi/administrationui.html){: target="_blank"}.

    -  When you configure the `schema`, open Configured Database Form and set the **Formula for Delete Access** to `@True` in default `Mode` in all `Forms`.See [Changes in Configuration Forms of Domino Rest API](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/Domino-rest-api/references/usingdominorestapi/administrationui.html#configure-a-form)

    -  When you configure the `schema`, open Database Form (configured) and set in `dql mode`, you must include all the fields of the `Form`. Both the `default` and `dql modes` fields must match for the form and fields to be seen as configured in the design import.

    -  When you configure the `schema`, open Database Views and set the Status to active.

    -  When you configure the `scopes`, you need a *Maximum Access Level* set to Designer or Manager. See [Scope in Domino Rest API](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/Domino-rest-api/references/usingdominorestapi/administrationui.html#add-a-scope)

    -  When you configure your DRAPI application, it's mandatory to add `$SETUP` to return proper values.

## CRUD operation upon importing the `.nsf` file

!!!note "Published the web app in Iris"
    - Before you can do the CRUD operation in your imported Domino application, you must first build and published the web in Iris.
    To do this, go to [Building a Web App](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_microapps/Content/WebPublish.html#publish-a-web-app){: target="_blank"}.

    - Log in to your account in Domino REST API using the newly published imported Domino application.
      Your configuration in Domino REST API decides what operations you can include in the **design import** form.
      All the `views` and `forms` of your `.nsf` file have been imported, so you can design your **`.nsf`** file with CRUD operation.

### Create entry

1. On the **Dashboard**, click your desired forms or table (example: Customer) under **Forms** label.  
    ![Screenshot](../assets/images/dinewview.png)

2. Click **Add New**.
3. Fill in the fields and click **Add**. This adds the data to the `.nsf` file.
