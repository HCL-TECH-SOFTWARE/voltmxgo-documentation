!!! warning "Important"

    - The installation and upgrade processes for Volt MX Go Foundry starting from the Volt MX Go v2.1 release differ from those of the Volt MX Go v2.0.4 and earlier releases. Starting from the Volt MX Go v2.1 release:

        - Volt Foundry is first installed, followed by installing the necessary plugins using the Volt MX Go Plugin Installer. The plugins enable the capabilities unique to Volt MX Go. Additionally, the plugins must be reinstalled each time Volt Foundry is upgraded.

        - Volt Foundry must be licensed with a Volt MX Go entitlement for the plugins to be enabled and for the Volt MX Go features to work.
    
    - Using this installation option would require you to use your own Domino server.
    
    - Before starting the installation, make sure to verify that you meet the [System requirements](sysreqindex.md).
