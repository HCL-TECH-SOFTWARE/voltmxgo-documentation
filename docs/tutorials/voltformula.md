# voltFormula Tutorial
The following tutorial shows you how to use voltFormula in Volt MX Iris to convert formulas from OpenFormula and NotesFormula into Volt MX Go rosetta javascript.

## Before you start

- You have completed the [Volt MX Go installation](installation.md).
- You have created your [Foundry admin account](../howto/foundryadminaccount.md).
- You have noted the following Domino REST API details:
    - Server URL: `http://drapi.mymxgo.com` 
    - username: `mxgo admin`
    - password: `password`
- You have to used the [actions](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/working_with_Action_Editor.html#search-for-an-action-in-action-editor) in Volt MX Iris.

## Introduction to the voltFormula

This feature in Volt MX Go Iris is an added actions in Volt MX Iris where you can insert the [OpenFormula](https://docs.oasis-open.org/office/OpenDocument/v1.3/OpenDocument-v1.3-part4-formula.html) and [NoteFormula](https://help.hcltechsw.com/dom_designer/10.0.1/basic/H_NOTES_FORMULA_LANGUAGE.html) translated into a javascript code.


## Open voltFormula through `Actions`

1. Open your **Project.**
2. From the **Project** tab of the **Project Explorer**, select the widget you want to apply the action to. 
3. Once itâ€™s highlighted on the Iris Canvas, right-click it, and then select one of the action sequences, such as `onTouchStart`, `onClick` and others.

## Translating the OpenFormula and NotesFormula into javascript

1. On the **action editor**, click the **Add Formula** on the diagram. On the right side of the **action editor** window, you can see the properties of the voltFormula.
    - **window for the translated openFormula and notesFormula in javascript.**
    - **window for the formula language** - OpenFormula and NotesFormula are the formulas to add in this window.
    - **window for the formula results**.

2. Click on **Formula Language** window and enter a valid formula.

    !!! note "Note"  
        In Formula language  window, it has the abilty to detect the **Notes** and **Open** formula. You must enter the **@** character before the formula in NotesFormula.
        and enter the **=** character before the formula in OpenFormula.
    
3. You can see the javascript code and the result.

4. Click **Save**.

        - **=** character  for *openFormula*
        - You can the see the sysntax code or the intellisense for the formula that you choose.
        - If you don't know how to convert the javascript in Volt MX Go`rosettajs` from **openFormula** and **NotesFormula**, you may use the Formula Language window to do so.
