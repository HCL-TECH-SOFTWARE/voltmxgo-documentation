# What's new in Volt MX Go v2.1.1

Release date - April DD, 2025

## New features

### Domino Adapter

- The maximum number of documents in the view of a generated data model in an Object Service can now be exposed via the `x_0040totalCount` meta field. For more information, see [Meta Fields](../topicguides/datamodel.md#meta-fields).

- The original Domino object model names, even those containing special characters, can now be exposed from the **Metadata** attribute of the `x_0040unid` field of a form or a view of a generated data model in an Object Service.

- Checks the Domino REST API version when generating an Object Service data model to ensure that the version of Domino REST API is compatible with and supports the latest features of the Domino Adapter. Users are advised to upgrade Domino REST API to the compatible version when the check fails.

- Users are now prompted to enter the Fully Qualified Domain Name of the server when clicking a document link on the Details page of a published Domino application. This redirects the user to the Notes web version of the document in a new browser tab.

## Improvements

- To ensure proper operation, the installed versions of Volt Foundry and Volt Iris are now checked for compatibility when installing the Volt MX Go plugins. If incompatible, the plugin installation stops, and users are informed of their current and required minimum Volt Foundry and Volt Iris versions.

### Domino Adapter

- Users can now see the updated documents in the **Response** after performing a **BULK UPDATE**, as their UNIDs are mapped to the `x_0040unid` field in Volt MX Go Foundry, even with the **Return Documents from Bulk Update** parameter set to false.
- Domino icons indicating links to Domino attachments are now supported and viewable on the built and published Domino application.
- The columns in the generated Grid form are now displayed similarly to the column arrangement in Domino, resulting in a better user experience.
- Added `x_0040warnings` metal-field for form-based data models. The `x_0040warnings` meta-field contains notifications, messages, or other relevant information that indicates potential issues that might need attention, providing users with a way to track and manage those issues.
