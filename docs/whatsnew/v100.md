# What's new in Volt MX Go v10.0

Release date - September 15, 2025

## New features

- Volt MX Go components are now pre-installed with Volt Foundry v10.0.1 and Volt Iris v10.0.1 and higher, allowing users to access Volt MX Go features while benefiting from enhancements to Volt Foundry and Volt Iris. A separate installer is no longer needed to enable the Volt MX Go components in Volt Foundry and Volt Iris.

    It's important to note that a Volt MX Go license must be used to activate Volt Foundry in the My HCLSoftware Portal for Volt MX Go features to work.

- VoltScript is now available as a custom code technology adapter for Volt Foundry Integration Service.

    - For more information on enabling VoltScript, see [Enable VoltScript in Volt Foundry](../howto/install/voltscript.md).
    - To learn more about VoltScript, see the [VoltScript Documentation](https://help.hcltechsw.com/docs/voltscript/early-access/index.html "Link opens a new tab"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}&nbsp;![link image](../assets/images/external-link.svg){: style="height:13px;width:13px"}.

- The Apache CouchDB[^1] adapter is now available as a business adapter for the Volt Foundry Object Service, enabling seamless integration between Volt Foundry applications and Apache CouchDB databases.

    To learn more about the Apache CouchDB adapter, refer to the related [topic guide](../topicguides/couchtopicguide.md) and complete the [tutorial](../tutorials/couch.md).

### Design Import  

- The *Designer Profile* feature stores the information you enter in the **Design Import Wizard** when creating an Identity Service in a profile. This profile can be reused the next time you start Design Import to allow you to go directly to the **Scope and Forms** page. This streamlines the import process, which enables quicker access to the design elements to be imported.

    For more information, see [Import a Domino application](../howto/designimport/diimport.md).

- Implemented the `GroupByList` component for imported views in Volt Iris, enabling users to customize data display and grouping for improved data organization and user experience in Volt Iris-published Domino applications.

- The logout action is now supported from the logout button in the header of all forms within the Volt Iris-published Domino application.  

<!-- Added support for Double-Byte Character Set that now allows import of forms and views with DBCS character names.-->

### Domino Adapter

- Added support for the view column `isHidden` property. For more information, see [Column characteristics](../topicguides/adapter/datamodel.md#column-characteristics).

### VoltFormula

#### Volt Iris

- Users can now use formula language to define the following UI widget properties:

    - Visible
    - Text
    - ToolTip
    - Enable Blur
    - Mask Text
    - Max Characters
    - Sensitive Text

    For more information, see [Define widget properties using formula language](../howto/voltformula/widgetprop.md).

- Added a new **Converter Configuration** option that enables a user to specify how to handle unknown or undefined variables in formula parameters. For more information see [Configure VoltFormula](../howto/voltformula/configrosetta.md).

## Improvements

### Design Import

- Enhances the user experience when creating a new identity service using the **Design Import Wizard**, as users can now verify the entered value in the **App Secret** field on the **Create New Identity Service** page by clicking and holding the eye icon to display the masked value.

- Added a tooltip on the **Create New Identity Service** page in the **Design Import Wizard** to inform users that an *MXGO* prefix will be added to their input in the **Service Name** field.

### Domino Adapter

- Improved user experience when using the configured Object Service in Volt Foundry, as the connection timeout to the Domino REST API has been extended, resulting in fewer login prompts.

### VoltFormula

#### Rosetta API

- The Rosetta-only specific functions are now classified under a new **Custom** category, making it easier to identify those functions exclusive to the Rosetta formula language.

- The Rosetta-only specific functions `debug()`, `context()`, and `restfulAPI()` are now usable from OpenFormula as `=DEBUG`, `=CONTEXT`, and `=RESTFULAPI`, respectively.

- Updated the [Rosetta API reference documentation](../javadoc/index.html).

#### Volt Iris

- Updated formula samples for `@Debug`, `@Context`, and `@RestfulAPI` Rosetta-only specific functions.

## Resolved issues

### Design Import

- Fixed issue with form generation if the `@Prompt` Formula Language component was added to a project. Also addressed the issue where the Update form mappings malfunctioned after saving or reloading when the `@Prompt` Formula Language component was added to a project.

- Resolved the issue with field selection in the **Design Import Wizard**, ensuring that only the chosen fields appear in the generated application.

- Fixed the issue that generated an error when clicking the **Refresh** icon on the **Scope and Forms** page of the **Design Import Wizard**. 

### Domino Adapter

- Fixed the issue related to invalid mapping for the delete object when generating forms for an object service that has both Form and View data models.

### VoltFormula

- Fixed the issue in the conversion mechanism that removed the `@` character from all Notes @functions that use no parentheses, such as `@True`.

- Fixed the CORS issue related to Domino REST API.

### Volt Iris

- Fixed the issue with the incorrect rendering of checkboxes and radio buttons in a Volt Iris-published Domino application.

- Fixed the issue where a user was unable to click the last item in an Agent list in a Volt Iris-published Domino application.

## Others

### Domino Adapter

- Added examples for querying date ranges. For details, see the examples table in [Supported OData query parameters for form-based GET method](../topicguides/adapter/method.md#supported-odata-query-parameters-for-form-based-get-method).
