# Show Domino Agents as part of the Design Import app

--8<-- "mxgoversion.md"

**Domino Agents** which are part the HCL Domino are part of the `nsf` that only Domino Designer can be able to modify. These `nsf` will be able to use by the Domino REST API to be able to use it for other services. Only those configured Agents in a `nsf` will be available to amend by the Domino REST API. These **Agents** will be imported to Volt MX Go Iris as part of the Design Import. 

For more information, see [Agents](https://help.hcltechsw.com/dom_designer/14.0.0/basic/H_ABOUT_DESIGNING_AGENTS.html) in the HCL Domino Designer documentation.

      ![Dashboard](../assets/images/diviewagent.png)
      
       The **Customers B ByRegion** will open. 
       
      ![Customers B ByRegion window](../assets/images/diagentview.png)
  
  
  2. **Agents** action will be available on the navigation bar. Click the **Agents**.

      ![Agents context menu](../assets/images/diactions.png)

  3. Click the **actions** *West to East*.
