# Import Domino Agents

  **Domino Agents** which are part the HCL Domino are part of the `nsf` that only Domino Designer can be able to modify. These `nsf` will be able to use by the Domino REST API to be able to use it for other services. Only those configured Agents in a `nsf` will be available to amend by the Domino REST API. These **Agents** will be imported to Volt MX Go Iris as part of the Design Import.
