# Modify or update imported actions using VoltFormula

!!!note

When importing a Domino application using Design Import, you have the option of selecting and including the actions from the Domino view in the import process. The imported actions from the Domino view are automatically converted with `voltmx.rosettajs` syntax, incorporating formula languages like Notes and OpenFormula.Â
