# What's new in Volt MX Go v2.1.1

Release date - Month DD, YYYY

## New features

### Domino Adapter

- The maximum number of documents in the view of a generated data model in an Object Service can now be exposed via the `x_0040totalCount` meta field. For more information, see [Data models](../../topicguides/datamodel.md).

- The original Domino object model names, even those containing special characters, can now be exposed from the **Metadata** attribute of the `x_0040unid` field of a form or a view of a generated data model in an Object Service.

## Improvements

### Domino Adapter

- Users can now see the updated documents in the **Response** after performing a **BULK UPDATE**, as their UNIDs are mapped to the `x_0040unid` field in Volt MX Go Foundry, even with the **Return Documents from Bulk Update** parameter set to false.
- Domino icons indicating links to Domino attachments are now supported and viewable on the built and published Domino application.
- The columns in the generated Grid form are now displayed similarly to the column arrangement in Domino, resulting in a better user experience.
