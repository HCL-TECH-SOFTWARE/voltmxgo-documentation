## Improvements

### Domino Adapter 

- Supports uploading and downloading of attachments up to 1 GB in size via Volt MX Go Foundry binary APIs. For more information, see [Attachments](../../topicguides/method.md#attachments).

### Design Import

- Enhances user experience by providing more information related to the import process at different steps of the **Design Import Wizard**.
- Supports Hierarchical View in imported Domino applications.
- Improvements in Rich Text import introduced with Domino Adapter enhancements.
- Added an option in the **Design Import Wizard** for deleting existing forms. For more information, see [Delete existing forms while using the Design Import wizard](../../howto/deleteform.md). 
- Added a refresh feature in the **Design Import Wizard** to update the scope in case there are changes in the Domino REST API schema without exiting the wizard. 

### VoltFormula

#### Rosetta API

- Simplified use of different Date types and provides `dateOrDateList` support for date, string, number, error, and arrays. 
- Added Intellisense definitions for the `Set` Notes function for *formula* category APIs.
- Updated operation APIs to accept infinite operands.
- Updated math operation to adjust Dates during math operations from milliseconds to seconds.
- Implemented the following improvement modifications:

    |Category|Description|
    |:---|:---|
    |date-time|- Supports Domino time zones for `timeMerge()` API. </br>- Updated `yesterday()` and `tomorrow()` to return date only.</br>- Updated `date()` to accept milliseconds for internal call.|
    |text|- Updated `abstract()` to throw NPTI.</br>- Added format support for `text()`.|
    |document|- Supported NOSORT option for `prompt()`.</br>- Added `excludeMIMEBody` parameter for `attachments()` and `attachmentNames()`.|
    |formula|- Updated `eval()` to detect valid return position both for async function.|

- Implemented improvements in error handling and fixes in the formula API implementations.

#### Rosetta Converter

- Implemented Formula to JavaScript conversion improvements in the areas of async usage, anonymous functions, parameter groupings, and variable definitions.
- Implemented improvements in the conversion handling definition rules for converting formula functions into native JavaScript versus API calls. For more information, see [VoltFormula options in the Volt MX Go Iris Project Settings](../../howto/configrosetta.md) dialog.
- Rosetta sample formulas are now part of the converters.
- Supports passthrough setting in OpenFormula. 
- Supports OpenFormula parameter separator semicolon.
- Supports Notes Formula date format having colon or dash. 
- Supports Notes Formula time format having milliseconds. 
- Supports chained assignments.
- Validates formula name existence. 
- Converts Notes formula `@Set` and `@Length`, and Open formula `=LET` to JavaScript statement.
- Passed param for `@IsAvailable` and `@IsUnavailable` as string.
- Converts Notes operators to Rosetta APIs.
- Moved variable definition inside Notes formula to function scope.
- Made native js to anonymous function by condition and removed nativeness check for `do`, `while`, `doWhile`, and `for`.
- Cleanup variable definition conversion mixed with var and let to var.
- Converts openformula specific operators such as `&`,`^`,`<>`.
- Converts the same operations to one api call with multiple parameters
- `@DocChildren`, `@DocDescendants`, `@Eval`, `@Name`, `@Responses` to async list.


#### Plugin

- Provides sample formulas for Volt MX Go Iris using formulas from the converters.
- Improved Volt MX Go Iris VoltFormula plugin (mbaas_sdk_rosetta) loading and logging process.

#### Volt MX Go Iris

- Logs more details using Debug and Info log channels that focus on plugin inspection and download processes, resulting in improved plugin download logging and recovery.
- Enhanced the formula and JavaScript type-ahead (IntelliSense) capabilities within Volt MX Go Iris IDE.
- Updated VoltPrompt components with ability to bypass user interaction notification dialogs.


## Resolved issues

### Design Import

- The UNID field was shown in the Update form after import.
- Some fields in the Update form had missing data after import. 
- An issue occurred in the **Design Import Wizard** since the number of characters in the Object Service name exceeded the limitation.

### VoltFormula

- On the **Action Editor** in Volt MX Go Iris, the **Add Formula** action was shown for the *Apple Watch* channel even though JavaScript wasn't supported.

#### Rosetta API

- Fixed examples in Notes formula documentation.
- Fixed Tern definition for Notes Date function.
- Fixed `Adjust()` to calculate date adjustments the way Notes does adjustments, that's right to left adjustments.
- Fixed TimeMerge API time portion parsing.
- For *date-time* category, fixed  how `Adjust` was handling leap years
- For *text* category, fixed `AbstractSimple` support for RichText fields.
- For *text* category, fixed how `TimeToTextInZone` determines yesterday.
- For *date-time* category, fixed how `Zone` handles no arguments.
