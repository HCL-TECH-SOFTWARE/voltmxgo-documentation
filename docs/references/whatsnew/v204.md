# What's new in Volt MX Go v2.0.4
*Release date: July 8, 2024*

## New features

### Domino Adapter

- Added `Other Metadata` entity type that enables a user to access additional Domino information not included in Domino data documents. The `Other Metadata` entity type currently supports an endpoint for getting Domino user information. For more information, see [Other Metadata](../../topicguides/datamodel.md#other-metadata).
- Added capability for checking duplicate fields when generating a data model from a Domino view, and returning an error message to warn a user that there are duplicate fields.

### VoltFormula

#### Rosetta API

- Implemented new APIs:

    |Category|API|
    |:---|:---|
    |*document*|`isCategory()`</br>`isResponseDoc()`|
    |*file*|`fileCloseWindow()`</br>`filePrint()`|
    |*formula*|`updateFormulaContext()`|
    |*miscellaneous*|`hashPassword()`|
    |*window*|`closeWindow()`</br>`reloadWindow()`</br>`windowMaximize()`</br>`windowMinimize()`|
    
    For more information, see the [Rosetta API reference documentation](../../javadoc/index.html).
    
#### Volt MX Go Iris

- Added a **Clear** button to the Formula Editor to enable a user to delete the shown formula. 
- Added a context menu option to delete a formula when right-clicking the formula in JavaScript code in the Formula Editor.

## Improvements

### Domino Adapter

- Enhances readability and functionality of generated Domino forms and views containing DBCS characters in their names.
- Enables *Details* form, generated in Volt MX Go Iris based on Domino Object, to display images embedded in the Rich Text field in Domino. 
- Removes the Rich Text fields from the generated *Grid* form in Volt MX Go Iris to enhance performance and match the behavior in Domino.  

### VoltFormula

#### Rosetta API

    |Category|Description|
    |:---|:---|
    |*database*|Implemented enhancements to the `getDocField()` and `setDocField()` APIs.|
    |*document*|Implemented enhancements to the `getField()` and `setField()` APIs.|
    |*text*|Improved detection of Rich Text in Text functions.|

- Fixed issues related to the `adjust()` API under the *date-time* category for edge of month cases.
- Fixed the "add" bug to enable concatenation of strings.  

#### Rosetta Converter

- Fixed definitions of relational operators and booleans for OpenFormula formula conversion.
- Fixed regression when using relational operators having equal (=) sign for OpenFormula formula conversion.

#### Volt MX Go Iris

- Fixed an issue where a previously converted JavaScript code isn't cleared when an invalid formula is entered in the Formula Editor. 
- Fixed an issue where the Formula Results header isn't hidden when the Formula Editor is dismissed.
- Fixed an issue, encountered when updating an existing formula, to reset the formula location when deleting the formula and prevent converted JavaScript code from being added back to the code editor.
- Fixed an issue to validate the formula context owner to capture the right formula and prevent the processing of unnecessary tasks. Â
