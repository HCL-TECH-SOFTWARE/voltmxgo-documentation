# What's new in Volt MX Go v2.0.4
*Release date: July 8, 2024*

## New features

### Domino Adapter

- Added `Other Metadata` entity type that enables a user to access additional Domino information not included in Domino data documents. The `Other Metadata` entity type currently supports an endpoint for getting Domino user information. For more information, see [Other Metadata](../../topicguides/datamodel.md#other-metadata).
- Added capability for checking duplicate fields when generating a data model from a Domino view, and returning an error message to warn a user that there are duplicate fields.

## Improvements

### Domino Adapter

- Enhances readability and functionality of generated Domino forms and views containing DBCS characters in their names.
- Enables *Details* form, generated in Volt MX Go Iris based on Domino Object, to display images embedded in the Rich Text field in Domino. 
- Removes the Rich Text fields from the generated *Grid* form in Volt MX Go Iris to enhance performance and match the behavior in Domino.
