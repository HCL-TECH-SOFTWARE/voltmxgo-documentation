### Design Import

- There was an unnecessary `Form1` after import completion.
- The scope can't be reloaded after performing Domino REST API modifications.
- Import crashed or stopped responding when there were duplicate form and field names, or there was a lack of array for forms, fields, views, and agents. 

### VoltFormula

#### Rosetta API

- An issue occurred when generating definitions for custom API extensions.
- Replace Notes function wasn't providing accurate results when multiple instances used the same replacement values.

#### Rosetta Converter

- The `=` sign was removed during OpenFormula conversion.
- An issue occurred with the SELECT conversion.

## Others

### VoltFormula

- Removed the App Dev API Framework and App Dev Target Context from the Rosetta configuration file.
