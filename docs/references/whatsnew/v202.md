# What's new in Volt MX Go v2.0.2
*Release date: November 16, 2023*

## New Features

### Design Import

- Uploading and downloading attachments in Domino applications are now enabled through Design Import as Domino REST API allows configuration of the `$FILES` field.  
- The import of Domino applications now includes support for mobile and tablets. 
- The configuration of a single scope is now possible in the Identity Service of the Design Import wizard.

### VoltFormula

##### Iris: VoltFormula
- Display only the file name of the custom formula extension in the VoltFormula settings.
- 

Implemented updates to the [API Reference Documentation](../../javadoc/index.html).

## Improvements

- Volt IQ capabilities are now functional in Volt MX Go. For more information, see [Volt IQ](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Volt_IQ.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} in the Volt MX documentation.
- You can now build Windows and macOS Desktop applications with the latest release of Volt MX Go.

### Domino Adapter 

- Summernote Editor is automatically applied on Rich Text fields of CREATE and UPDATE forms when generating CRUD forms for Object Service.



## Resolved issues

### Domino Adapter 

- An updated document wasn't displayed on the Details form, and updates were reflected on the first document of the NSF file due to the empty filter query parameter on one of the Service Action objects on the Details form. The issue was encountered for forms without the `$FILES` Domino field.

### Design Import

- There was an unnecessary `Form1` after import completion.
- The scope can't be reloaded after performing Domino REST API modifications.
- Import crashed or stopped responding when there were duplicate form and field names, or there was a lack of array for forms, fields, views, and agents. 

## Others

- Updated [Compatibility matrix](../compatibilitymatrix.md).

### VoltFormula

- Removed the App Dev API Framework and App Dev Target Context from the Rosetta configuration file.
