# What's new in Volt MX Go v2.1
*Release date: December 19, 2024*

## New features

- Simplifies the installation of Volt MX Go server components on supported Kubernetes platforms using a single Helm chart. Using a single Helm chart also simplifies the upgrade of Volt MX Go server components on supported Kubernetes platforms to Volt MX Go v2.1.

    For more information, see installation and upgrade topics in [Install and upgrade](../../tutorials/installation.md).

### Domino Adapter

- Added **ServerInfo** endpoint for getting Domino and Domino REST API version information, and **AttachmentsInfo** endpoint for getting information of document attachments. For more information, see [Other Metadata](../../topicguides/datamodel.md#other-metadata).

- The scope name can now be exposed from the **Metadata** attribute of the `x_0040unid` field of a form or a view of a generated data model in an Object Service. 

- Added support for retrieving view documents using the query parameter `$filter=documentsOnly eq true` and retrieving distinct view documents using the query parameter `$filter=distinctDocuments eq true` when performing the view-based GET method. For more information, see [Supported OData query parameters for view-based GET method](../../topicguides/method.md#supported-odata-query-parameters-for-view-based-get-method).

## Improvements

### Design Import

- Implemented the following UI enhancements on the **Design Import Wizard** for better user experience:
    - Added filter buttons on the **Scope and Forms** page to easily filter the active, inactive, and unsupported forms, views, and agents. 
    - Added an expander arrow on the **Summary** page to simultaneously show or hide the details of the imported forms, views, or agents. 
    - Added the **Show failed imports** toggle on the **Agents** tab to easily identify imported agents with errors. 

### Domino Adapter

- Implemented UTF-8 encoding and decoding for all Rich Text content to ensure correct processing and display of DBCS characters.

## Resolved issues

### Volt MX Go Iris

- Fixed the issue where building the web app fails when executing **Build and Publish Web** and selecting *Release* as the **Build Mode**.

- Fixed an issue where an imported Domino application, published via **Build and Publish Web**, didn't function as expected. Specifically, the selected data by a view wasn't showing correctly, and a user couldn't add data to forms.Â 

### Volt MX Go Foundry

- Fixed the issue where a user can't edit an Active Directory Identity Provider configuration as the Active Directory configuration information was missing.

## Others  

- Added option for allowing users to configure Kubernetes Ingress for Domino REST API using their custom SSL certificate.

    For more information, see [Configure Kubernetes Ingress for Domino REST API](../../howto/drapiingress.md).

- Added details on how Design Import handles Domino database views with columns having the same name. For more information, see [Known limitations](../knownlimitation.md#domino-database-view-with-duplicate-column-names).

### Domino Adapter
