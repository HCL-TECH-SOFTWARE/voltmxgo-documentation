# What's new

The section provides information on the latest features, improvements, and resolved issues related to Volt MX Go.

## Volt MX Go v2.0.1

### New features
*VoltScript* is a [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC){: target="_blank"} scripting language for use with HCL Volt MX Go as a server-side scripting language running within the Foundry middleware layer. *VoltScript* includes:

- Visual Studio Code extension for allowing developers to write code in VS Code
- Linux Docker image for allowing Mac developers to use the VS Code extension
- Language enhancements for improving consistency and ease of use
- Open-source helpers, such as a library with advanced collection and map collections, a unit testing framework, and a serializer and deserializer for JSON-based object persistence
- A toolkit for scaffolding the various VoltScript extensions and script code and autogenerating starter code and related documentation
- Various VoltScript Extensions for supporting various processes, such as data access over HTTP to specific or generic REST services, handling JSON data, interacting with the operating system and files, managing input parameters

To learn more about the **early access version** of VoltScript and related components, see [VoltScript Documentation](https://help.hcltechsw.com/docs/voltscript/early-access/index.html){: target="_blank"}.  

##### Design Import
- Added Summernote Editor component in the Design Import wizard.

##### VoltFormula
- New Notes Formula function API implementations in the Date-Time, List, and User-Environment categories.



### Improvements

##### Design Import

- The single scope is now compatible with Domino REST API v1.0.7.
- When a pre-existing Domino REST API service is used, the wizard may now manage multiple services in addition to the one generated by the wizard.
- Sort the scope list alphabetically in the view form.
- Unconfigured forms are now hiding all the fields. 

##### VoltFormula

- API
    - Document Category APIs
        - Change `SetField` to Commit DB changes to the server
        - New default for API Context: `'all'`; for use by `GetField`/`SetField`
         - `FileSave` enhancements.
    - Expose Volt MX-specific functions in the API config category.
    - Updates to API Reference Documentation. See [API reference documentation](../javadoc/index.html)


- MX Go Iris
    - Intellisense:
        - Allow lookups for multiple levels in Open Formula.
        - Support wildcard category search by using an asterisk.
        - Type-ahead is now function arguments for formula language as well as JavaScript.
        - Find the component body for a module.
    - Code Editors:
        - Action editor improvements for formula snippet
        - Delay formula conversion call with configurable milliseconds timer
        - Show formula results on-demand.
    - Additional logged information about VoltFormula download and initialization status.
    - Additional configuration settings and statics in the project configuration
  
##### First Touch

-  Improved First Touch Recipes app by adding function that brings up a list of related recipes from the same cuisine when checking a recipe, and implemented general improvements to the mobile version. 

### Resolved issues

##### Domino Adapter
- Using special characters as part of the search parameter for the `$filter` in the `GET` method returned errors. An example is the `=` sign in the search parameter value `col1 eq B=S`. Performing GET method with `$filter=col1 eq B=S` would return an error. You have to enter it as `$filter=col1 eq Bx_003dS`.
- The `$FILES` field wasn't usable for the `$filter` query parameter to find documents with a specified attachment, for example, `$filter=x_0024FILES eq attName.txt`. 
- An incorrect access token was used for an operation when multiple users performed operations simultaneously while using a shared connection instance to a Domino REST API server.  
- Iris threw an exception on a `GET` operation on view data models when the maximum depth of the view hierarchy is more than two hierarchy levels. An example of a view hierarchy with more than two hierarchy levels is a document with a response and a response to that response. 

##### VoltFormula

- API Fixes
    - Fixes the 0 seconds or minutes in @Date function.
    - Fix: documentation of arrays
    - In the API Reference, the `Compatibility` category has been removed.
    - Fixes the use of the function MROUND instead of ROUND.
    - Fixes the  Notes @ReplaceSubstring  bug.
    - Fixes the API reference for Note `businessDays`.

### Others

- Added details related to kubectl commands failing in [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot.md).
- Added details related to using helm charts on supported Kubernetes platform in [Known limitations](knownlimitation.md).
- Added upgrade procedures in [Installation and upgrade](../tutorials/installation.md). 
##### First Touch
- Added procedure for [importing First Touch into Iris](../howto/importft.md).
##### Domino Adapter
- Added procedure for [generating CRUD forms for an Object Service](../howto/codegen.md).
- Added details related to deleting offline documents in [Known limitations](knownlimitation.md).
