# What's new

The section provides information on the latest features, improvements, and resolved issues related to Volt MX Go.

## Early Access v3

### New Features

- Added Summernote Editor component in Iris to allow users to enter or edit rich text content in  **Create** and **Update** forms generated from Domino objects.
- Added readiness and liveness probes support to the Domino REST API Helm chart. The readiness probe is used by a service to know if a container is available to handle requests. If it fails the configured thresholds, the service is marked as not ready and won't route requests. The liveness probe is similar to the readiness probe. However, if it fails the configured thresholds, the container is killed and restarted. These probes are present and customizable.

#### VoltFormula
- Added Typeahead IntelliSence in the configuration which can be seen in the rosetta formula which can be seen in [Configuration of Rosetta API setting](../howto/configrosetta.md)

### Improvements

##### First Touch
- Users can now view and explore the First Touch Recipe Catalog app by launching it from Foundry. <!--To learn more about the app, see [First Touch app](../topicguides/firsttouchapp.md).-->

##### Domino Adapter
- Updated the Rich Text field format in Foundry Object Services to Base64-encoded HTML
- Added support for the PATCH method for form-based data models.
- Support OData filter parameter for the GET method on form-based data models to return a documentâ€™s unknown form name using the document's UNID. For more information, see [Supported OData filter parameters, form-based GET](../topicguides/dominoadapter.md#supported-odata-filter-parameters-form-based-get).
- Enhanced object service code generation in Iris for Domino objects so that when using the **Generate Forms** function: 

    - The GRID and DETAILS forms show rich text via the Rich Text widget.
    - The CREATE form allows users to specify the rich text field content using the Summernote Editor Iris component.
    - The UPDATE form allows users to edit the rich text using the Summernote Editor Iris component.  

<!-- Added support for *GET document with an unknown form* OData filter parameter for the GET method on form-based data models.-->
