# Design Import

Design Import reads a Domino application through the Domino REST API, retrieves design elements from the application, including forms, views, and agents, and presents them to the user. The user can then decide which forms and fields to import.

Design Import builds the forms and views within Volt Iris and makes them actionable against object services in the Domino Adapter (CRUD operations). The forms and views are presented as a simplified list for better navigation.
