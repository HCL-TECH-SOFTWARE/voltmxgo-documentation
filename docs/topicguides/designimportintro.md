# Design Import

This new feature in Volt MX Go Iris allows users to import all the **`.NSF`** data in accordance with the format provided by the Domino REST API. All the forms, views, and agents are imported into Iris forms, along with the possibility of performing **CRUD** operations. When the project is put into production, you will have access to the `.NSF` file, and you will be able to do the **CRUD** operations in each of the forms. Notes Designer and this information are in sync with one another.
