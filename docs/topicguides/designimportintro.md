# Design Import

Design Import reads a Domino application through the Domino REST API, retrieves design elements from the application, including forms, views, and agents, and presents them to the user. The user can then decide which forms and fields to import. 

Design Import builds the forms and views within Volt MX Go Iris and makes them actionable against object services in the Domino Adapter (CRUD operations). The forms and views are presented as a simplified list for better navigation.

<!--
## Overview

This new feature in Volt MX Go Iris allows users to import all the **`.NSF`** data in accordance with the format provided by the Domino REST API. All the forms, views, and agents are imported into Volt MX Go Iris forms, along with the possibility of performing **CRUD** operations. When the project is put into production, you will have access to the `NSF` file, and you will be able to do the **CRUD** operations in each of the forms. **Notes Designer**Â and this information are in sync with one another.

## Objective

The aim of Design Import is to expose all the data of an **NSF** file including the forms, agents, and views and to do the **CRUD** operations just like the **Notes Designer**.
