# VoltFormula

What ideas do you think whenever you hear the word "formula?" It refers to a string of words, a collection of mathematical processes, or an expression with the purpose of producing results as an output. The description of this formula and this VoltFormula are the same. MX Go voltFormula  function of MX GO is responsible for converting the formula used on other Formula Language platforms into the javascript programming language. This is essential to those existing users of Notes and Excel that wants to convert their existing formula into a javascript language.

## Three platforms supported by VoltFormula

 1. [Open Formula](https://docs.oasis-open.org/office/OpenDocument/v1.3/OpenDocument-v1.3-part4-formula.html)
 2. [Notes Formula/Formula Language](https://help.hcltechsw.com/dom_designer/10.0.1/basic/H_NOTES_FORMULA_LANGUAGE.html)
 3.  voltFormula - Own formula and function created inside its language.

## Objectives of VoltFormula

The aim of VoltFormula is to expose all the capability to run certain functions of OpenFormula (excel) and Formula Language (Notes @Function) in the context of Volt MX GO. This converts certain function of OpenFormula and Formula language into a javascript. This javascript is use to build web-based applications. This help or to guide all the existing users of Formula Language and OpenFormula to keep and transition into a web-based app. The VoltFormula reveals the javascript without any problem in converting the existing formula n OpenSource and Formula Language.

It refers to a string of words, a collection of mathematical processes, or an expression with the purpose of producing results as an output. The description of this "formula" and our Volt Formula are the same. MX Go Volt Formula, function of MX Go, is responsible for converting the formula used on other Formula Language platforms into the JavaScript programming language. This is essential for existing users of Notes and Excel who want to convert their existing formulas into the JavaScript language. 

## Two platforms supported by Volt Formula

 1. [Open Formula](https://docs.oasis-open.org/office/OpenDocument/v1.3/OpenDocument-v1.3-part4-formula.html)
 2. [Notes Formula Language](https://help.hcltechsw.com/dom_designer/10.0.1/basic/H_NOTES_FORMULA_LANGUAGE.html)

These two are wrapped into one parent formula language that encapsulates both implementations.  We call this VoltFormula, aka RosettaJS.  By nature of being a javascript exposed API library, the formula langauage can be extended via helper registration methods
