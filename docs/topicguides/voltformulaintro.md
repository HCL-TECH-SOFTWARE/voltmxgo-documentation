# VoltFormula

What ideas do you think of whenever you hear the word "formula"? It refers to a string of words, a collection of mathematical processes, or an expression with the purpose of producing results as an output. The description of this "formula" and our Volt Formula are the same. MX Go Volt Formula, function of MX Go, is responsible for converting the formula used on other Formula Language platforms into the JavaScript programming language. This is essential for existing users of Notes and Excel who want to convert their existing formulas into the JavaScript language. 

## Two formula languages exposed as one implementation by Volt Formula

 1. [Open Formula](https://docs.oasis-open.org/office/OpenDocument/v1.3/OpenDocument-v1.3-part4-formula.html)
 2. [Notes Formula Language](https://help.hcltechsw.com/dom_designer/10.0.1/basic/H_NOTES_FORMULA_LANGUAGE.html)

These two are wrapped into one parent formula language that encapsulates both implementations.  We call this VoltFormula, aka RosettaJS.  By nature of being a javascript exposed API library, the formula langauage can be extended via helper registration methods.

## Objective of Volt Formula

The aim of Volt Formula is to expose the capability to run certain functions of OpenFormula (excel) and Formula Language (Notes @Function) in the context of Volt MX Go. This converts certain functions of OpenFormula and Formula Language into JavaScript. This JavaScript is used to build web-based applications. This is to help or to guide all the existing users of Formula Language and OpenFormula to transition into a web-based app. The Volt Formula reveals the JavaScript without any problem in converting the existing formulas in OpenSource and Formula Language.
